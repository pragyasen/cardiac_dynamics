# Cardiac Dynamics
Used a two-variable system to study the voltage flux across cardiac cell membranes in case of Cardiac Arrhythmia and for a regularly functioning heart. The implementation was performed using MATLAB.

## Motivation
Cardiac Arrhythmia, or irregular heart beat, is a name for a large family of cardiac behaviors that show abnormalities in the electrical behavior of the hard. A heartbeat that is too fast (“tachycardia”) or too slow (“bradycardia”) can be fatally dangerous. Other examples of arrhythmias include heart palpitations, stroke, and embolism. The natural pacemaker of the heart is called the sinoatrial node. Pacemaker cells are polarized. When the cells generate an electrical impulse (a cardiac action potential), voltage gated channels open to allow charge to move through the cell, creating heartbeats. These cardiac dynamics can be modeled with the help of a system of nonlinear ordinary differential equations. With the help of MATLAB, required graphs are generated to visualize the problem.

## The Basic Model
We use a two-variable system to study the voltage flux across cardiac cell membranes, which can give insight to how and why arrhythmias form:

If h = 0, voltage can pass freely. <br>
If h > 0, then the gate reduces the voltage passing into the cell. <br>
If h is an extremely large value, the gate is essentially closed. <br>
S(t) represents the electrical impulse generated by the pacemaker. <br>
a represents the threshold excitation in the system. <br>
k controls the magnitude of the electric current across the cell membrane. <br>
vh describes the repolarization current in the recovery process. <br>
